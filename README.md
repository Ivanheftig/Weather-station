# Weather-station
A solar powered weather station which uploads data to Adafruit IO aswell as a display

This project is a final project in school

The hardware required (not solar panels) are:
* Sparkfun micromord weather carrier board
* Sparkfun micromod input and display carrier board
* 2x Sparkfun micromod ESP32 processor
* Sparkfun weather meter kit

This project was written entirely in the Arduino IDE software. It was built to get the weather at our school.
This project has a QR-code which leads to the Adafruit IO dashboards where more weather data is being displayed.
Because there are 2 processors there are 2 seperate codes. One for the display and one for the weather carrier board.
